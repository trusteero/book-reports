Childhood friends are waiting, old bonds spark back to life, and a first love she thought was lost resurfaces in ways she never expected.

    "readership": "This book aligns closely with readers of contemporary and New Adult romance, especially those drawn to second-chance and friends-to-lovers tropes. Engagement is strongest among 18\u201334 year olds, with a female skew but meaningful inclusivity across genders. Discovery pathways include BookTok, Instagram, and romance-focused newsletters, while ebook and audiobook preferences ensure high accessibility and shareability. Thematically, the summer camp backdrop and ensemble friendships tap into under-served niches, expanding reach beyond core romance circles.",
    "classification": "Within a bespoke taxonomy of romance subgenres, the novel positions itself at the intersection of second-chance and friends-to-lovers romance, framed through a nostalgic summer-camp setting. This hybrid classification creates distinctiveness in a crowded market while remaining familiar to fans of bestselling comparables like Emily Henry and Carley Fortune.",
    "personas": "The primary persona, Samantha the YA Romance Enthusiast, highlights the book's resonance with younger readers who see their own coming-of-age transitions reflected in the narrative. Marcus, the New Adult Escapist, represents a secondary audience of slightly older readers who value stories of healing and emotional resilience, broadening the book's demographic reach.",
    "marketingGuidance": "The marketing insights provide actionable direction for early campaigns, suggesting hooks around camp nostalgia, second chances, and ensemble friendship arcs. Copy can emphasize warmth, discovery, and heartfelt intimacy, while creative assets should highlight seasonal settings and emotional stakes. These foundations will later expand into a standalone marketing product, but for now serve as a strategic toolkit to drive launch momentum."
